# GameInv WPF

## Description

This is a version of [GameInv C# Server](/server) with a WPF GUI. Only supported on Windows 7+ and no
other OS. Tested on Windows 11. This version does not have a WebSocket client, does not have TUI and only has an
integrated WPF GUI with optional DB connection. As the folder name suggests, it is not maintained to be up-to-date with
the main [C# server](/server), but it could/should/will be merged with it as a secondary project in the solution.

## Usage

[Download](https://github.com/MP3Martin/GameInv/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone this repo, open the
`server-wpf-unmaintained` folder in your favourite IDE (usually Visual Studio or Rider) and click **run**. All other
[configurations](/README.md#configuration) should be the same.
